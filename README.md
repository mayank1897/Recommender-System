# Recommender-System

The dataset for this competition is a relational set of files describing customers orders over time. The goal of the project is to predict which products will be in a user's next order. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, there are between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order.
